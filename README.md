Call Api using redux thunk middleware in React.js

Pros and Cons of using Redux Thunk for API calls in a React application:

Pros:

Middleware Support: Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This is particularly useful for making asynchronous API calls.

Control Over Dispatch: With Redux Thunk, you have control over dispatch. This means you can dispatch multiple actions in response to a single event, such as an API call. For example, you might dispatch one action when an API call starts (to show a loading spinner), another if the call was successful (to store the data), and another if the call failed (to show an error message).

Testability: Redux Thunk makes it easier to write tests for your asynchronous actions. You can mock the Redux store and assert that the correct actions were dispatched.

Popularity and Community Support: Redux Thunk is widely used in the React community, which means there are plenty of resources and community support available.

Cons:

Complexity: Redux Thunk can add complexity to your application, especially for beginners. Understanding how thunks work and when they are necessary can be challenging.

Verbose Code: Redux Thunk can lead to verbose code, especially for simple use cases. For every API call, you typically need to dispatch at least three different actions (start, success, failure), which can make your code harder to read and maintain.

Overkill for Simple Applications: If your application is simple and doesn't require complex state management or asynchronous actions, using Redux Thunk might be overkill. Other state management solutions or React's built-in state management features might be more suitable.

Requires Additional Libraries for Side Effects: Redux Thunk doesn't handle more complex side effects out of the box. If you need to handle things like cancelling requests, race conditions, or more complex async logic, you might need to use additional libraries like Redux Saga or Redux Observable.
